# Typescript

- TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- TypeScript is known as Object oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a scripting language.
- TypeScript gives support for modules whereas JavaScript does not support modules.
- TypeScript has Interface but JavaScript does not have Interface.

## Javascpit and Typescrpit

- Typescpit is a Oject-Oriented language
- Typescpit has a featrue know as Static typing
- Typescpit gives support for modules
- Typescpit support optional parameter
- Javascpit a scrping language
- Javascpit does not have static typing
- Javascpit does not support modules
- Javascpit does not support optional parameter

## benefits of TypeScpit

- fast, simple and easy to lrean an run any boswer or javascpit engine
- simler to javascpit
- typescpit code extenting javascpit code

## tsc

- tsc typeScrpit_FileName.ts
- node javaScrpit_fileName.ts

## 1. Annotations

- TypeScript is a typed language
- we can specify the type of the variables
- using :Type after the name of the variable

## 2. Variable

1. var
   - javascrpit same rules
2. let
   - let is block-scpo
3. const
   - must be declared and initailzed in single satement
   - value cannot changed
   - let scpoing rule

## 3. data types

- The data type classification are Two type
  1.  Built-in Datatypes (Primitive types)
      1. number
      2. string
      3. boolean
      4. null - null is an assignment value (typeof object)
      5. undefind - undefind not been assignment value (typeof undefind)
      6. void
      7. symbol
  2.  User-defined Data Types (Object types)
      1. array - we can store multiple value in single varbile
      2. functions
      3. class
      4. Touple
      5. Enum
      6. interface

## 3.Loops

1.  while
2.  do..while
3.  for
4.  for..in
5.  for..of
6.  forEach()

## 4. Function

- Function is a block of code
- JavaScript supports overriding not overloading
- Method Overloading and Method Overriding support in typescpit

1. Named function
2. Nameless(anonymous) function
   - does not have any name
   1. Immediate execution of a function
   2. object inside function of value in javascript
3. Arrow function
   - ES6 introduced a new and shorter way of declaring an anonymous function
   1. single statement returns a value, remove brackets and return keyword:
   2. multipe statement returns a value, apply brackes and return keyword:
   3. Arrow Function as an Expression
   4. object inside function of value in javascript
4. Callback function
   - A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument
   - Benefit of Callback Function
     - wait for the result of a previous function call and then execute another function call.
   - examples :- filter(),sort()...

## 5. Opps

- Object oriented programming, or OOP for short, is a popular approach to solving problems in programming languages.
- Easier debuging
- Effective problem solving

1. class & object
   - Class is user defined blueprint.
   1. Set of properties or methods
   2. instantitate an object of a class
   3. access propartys and methords
   4. constructor
   5. this
   6. access Modifiers
      - Public
      - Private
      - Protected
   7. Static
      - Static variables
      - Static methods
   8. readonly, optional parameters
   9. super
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
